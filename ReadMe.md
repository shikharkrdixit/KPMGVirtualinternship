This repository contains the three different tasks in the KPMG Virtual Internship Program which I took up on April,2021.

This was a month long program in which we had to focus mainly on three tasks which are:

> 1. **Data Quality Assessment** [here](https://github.com/shikharkrdixit/KPMGVirtualinternship/tree/main/Task%201)

> 2. **Data Insights** [here](https://github.com/shikharkrdixit/KPMGVirtualinternship/tree/main/Task%202)

> 3. **Data Insights and Presentation** [here](https://github.com/shikharkrdixit/KPMGVirtualinternship/tree/main/Task%203)

The final interactive plot is present [here](https://rpubs.com/shikharkrdixit/interactivedashboardKPMG)

This was a fun internship program where I learnt new things, such as building Interactive Plots and the working environment was also very close to real-time corporate environment.
