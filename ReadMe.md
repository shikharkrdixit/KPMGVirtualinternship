This repository contains the three different tasks in the KPMG Virtual Internship Program which I took up on April,2021.

This was a month long program in which we had to focus mainly on three tasks which are:

- Data Quality Assessment

- Data Insights

- Data Insights and Presentation.

This was a fun internship program where I learnt new things, such as building Interactive Plots and the working environment was also very close to real-time corporate environment.
